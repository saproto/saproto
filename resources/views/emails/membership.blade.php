        Dear {{ $user->calling_name }},
    </p>

    <p>
        Welcome as the newest member of Study Association Proto! My name
        is {{ \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Config::string('proto.internal') }} and I would
        like to give a little introduction to the association. The room where you probably just signed up in is our
        association room called the Protopolis. In this room we offer free coffee and tea and sell other foods and
        drinks via the OmNomCom. At the OmNomCom you can also register various RFID-enabled cards for fast checkout.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an association we also organise a lot of activities, these activities are very diverse and can be both fun
        and educative. You can sign up for these activities on our <a href='https://www.proto.utwente.nl'>website</a>.
        We also have membership passes. You can pick yours up at the Protopolis and use it to get discounts at various
        stores and food-chains.
    </p>

    <p>
        With your membership also comes a Proto username. Your Proto username is
        <strong>{{ $user->member->proto_username }}</strong>. You can use this username instead of your e-mail address
        to log-in.
    </p>

    <p>
        For other Proto services outside the website, you have to use this username and your Proto password to log-in.
        On these other services, your University of Twente account or your e-mail address don't work. Before you can
        start using your Proto username outside of the website you'll need to activate your username. You do this by
        synchronizing your password to your username <a href="{{ route('login::password::sync::index') }}">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note: as a member of S.A. Proto you accept our <a
            href="https://wiki.proto.utwente.nl/ict/privacy/start?do=export_pdf" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.
        Please know that if you want to be updated when changes to the privacy policy are made, you
        should subscribe for notifications in the <i>e-mail lists</i> section of your <a
            href="{{ route('user::dashboard::show') }}">dashboard</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope to have informed you well via this e-mail, but should you have any questions left you can always come by
        at the Protopolis or send me an e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind regards,<br>
        {{ \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Config::string('proto.internal') }}<br>
        <i>On behalf of the board of Study Association Proto</i>
    </p>
