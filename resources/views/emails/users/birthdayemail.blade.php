    <p>Hi {{ $user->calling_name }},</p>

    <p>
        Happy birthday! Because we are so excited it is the day you were born,
        you can get a free cookie! Just hop by the Protopolis and ask a board
        member for your birthday cookie and we will be glad to help you out.

        <img
            alt="The board wishing you a happy birthday"
            src="{{ asset("images/emails/birthday.jpg") }}"
        />
    </p>

    <p>Have a great day, Board {{ Config::string("proto.boardnumber") }}</p>
