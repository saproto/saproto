    <p>Hey!</p>

    <p>
        I just ran the membership fee program. The following people had their
        membership fee charged.

        @if (count($charged_fees->regular) > 0)
            <p>
                <strong>Members paying the regular fee</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                @foreach ($charged_fees->regular as $user)
                    <li>{{ $user }}</li>
                @endforeach
            </ul>
        @endif

        @if (count($charged_fees->reduced) > 0)
            <p>
                <strong>Other people paying the reduced fee</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                @foreach ($charged_fees->reduced as $user)
                    <li>{{ $user }}</li>
                @endforeach
            </ul>
        @endif

        @if (count($charged_fees->remitted) > 0)
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Exceptions who don't pay membership fee, resolve manually as
                    needed
                </strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                @foreach ($charged_fees->remitted as $user)
                    <li>{{ $user }}</li>
                @endforeach
            </ul>
        @endif
    </p>

    <p>Kind regards, The Membership Fee Clerk</p>
