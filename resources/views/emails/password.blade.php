    <p>Dear {{ $name }},</p>

    <p>
        You receive this e-mail because you requested a new password for your
        account on the website of Study Association Proto. Using the link below,
        you can set a new password. But be quick! The link below only works for
        an hour, after which you need to request a new link.
    </p>

    <p class="text-break">
        <a
            href="{{ route('login::password::reset::token', ['token' => $token]) }}"
        >
            {{ route('login::password::reset::token', ['token' => $token]) }}
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you did not initiate a request for a new password, no worries! Just
        ignore this e-mail and everything will be dandy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind regards,
        <br />
        The Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again committee
