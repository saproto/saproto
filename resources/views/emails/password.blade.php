    <p>Dear {{ $name }},</p>

    <p>
        You receive this e-mail because you requested a new password for your account on the website of Study
        Association Proto. Using the link below, you can set a new password. But be quick! The link below only works for
        an hour, after which you need to request a new link.
    </p>

    <p class="text-break">
        <a href="{{ route('login::password::reset::token', ['token' => $token]) }}">
            {{ route('login::password::reset::token', ['token' => $token]) }}
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you did not initiate a request for a new password, no worries! Just ignore this e-mail and everything will be
        dandy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind regards,
        <br />
        The Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again committee
