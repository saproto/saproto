                        Throughout the whole curriculum, Creative Technology
                        students are faced with big ideas and little time.
                        Through experience, the students learn to what extent
                        they can develop their prototypes. From quick electrical
                        circuits just to show that it works to advanced
                        prototypes that only need better building materials:
                        CreaTe students have seen it all.

                        Interaction Technology aims to combine a scientific
                        mindset with specialist technical knowledge. I-Techers
                        analyse, design, validate and implement intelligent
                        interactive systems in their operational context. Recent
                        developments in hardware and computational technologies
                        are used in all kinds of projects. Students are taught
                        to become the new engineer: bridging disciplines within
                        project groups and understanding tech and their users.

                        Active and eager students from Creative Technology and
                        Interaction Technology come together in Study
                        Association Proto. One thing Proto stands out for is its
                        diverse, but close community. Students with different
                        nationalities, experiences, interests and skills form
                        the basis on which this community is built. Currently,
                        Proto consists of circa 700 members and 35 committees,
                        all held together by a full-time student board.

                        Besides organising lots of interesting activities for
                        entertainment and/or educational purposes, the community
                        also strengthens itself with its various ways of
                        thinking: whether it’s more practical and technical,
                        focused on design or art, or even business: everyone can
                        deliver his or her input.

                        Where time is always the issue, creativity most
                        certainly is not. With knowledge of user group habits,
                        the latest sensors, interfaces, databases and their
                        advantages and limits, Creative Technology and
                        Interaction Technology students learn how to connect the
                        right dots. Thanks to many brainstorm lessons and
                        sessions, the students know how to step outside the box
                        and let their ideas flow, whether it is on their own or
                        within a (multidisciplinary) project group.
