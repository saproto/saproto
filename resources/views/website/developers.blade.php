                            website of Study Association Proto
                        </a>
                        was released in the summer of 2016. For as far as you're
                        interested, it is mostly custom-built on the Laravel
                        framework. It is the successor of the WordPress website
                        we've been rocking since the association was founded in
                        2011.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The website is open source and actively maintained by a
                        dedicated committee of the association: the

                        </a>
                        . You will find the current members of this committee on
                        your right. Below this piece of prose you will also find
                        a list of the developers who have been contributing to
                        the association's ICT in the past.
